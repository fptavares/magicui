	After Raphael had discoursed with great judgment on the many errors that were both among
	 us and these nations; had treated of the wise institutions both here and there, and had
	 spoken as distinctly of the customs and government of every nation through which he had 
	 passed, as if he had spent his whole life in it, Peter, being struck with admiration, 
	 said: "I wonder, Raphael, how it comes that you enter into no king's service, for I am 
	 sure there are none to whom you would not be very acceptable: for your learning and knowledge 
	 both of men and things, are such that you would not only entertain them very pleasantly, 
	 but be of great use to them, by the examples you could set before them and the advices you 
	 could give them; and by this means you would both serve your own interest and be of great 
	 use to all your friends."
